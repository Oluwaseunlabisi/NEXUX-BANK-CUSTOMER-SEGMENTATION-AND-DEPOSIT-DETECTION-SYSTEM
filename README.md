## Problem Statement
Nexux bank has conducted campaigns with the goal of acquiring deposits. In the last board meeting, the directors where unsatisfied with their current situation and need to optimize the operations at Nexus bank. The Director of Nexux contacted you a Data Scientist because they are interested in leveraging the power of their data to gain insights into the bank and improve their efficiency. They want to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior to decipher if customer demographics such as age, educational level e.t.c influences customers attitude toward defaulting. The board specifically wants to anticipate future customer behavior and know the likelihood of subscription to term deposits from customers. Nexux wants to understand how effective their campaigns are and thus develop marketing campaigns to reach specific customer segments. By analyzing customer behaviors, loan trends, and marketing campaign effectiveness, Nexus wants to optimize its operations, mitigate risks/ loan defaults, and improve customer subscription to term deposit.

## Methodology
The following steps will be taken to achieve the goal of this project:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Modelling - KMeans clustering is used to do the Customer segmentation and 8 models will be evaluated for the classification task. Training and test data will be split into 70:30.
- Model Evaluation - Each of the 8 models will be compared and evaluated.

These will help the management of Nexux bank to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money on marketing to every customer in the bank’s database, they can analyze which customer segment is most likely to subscribe to term deposit and then market the product only to that particular segment. In short, for marketing campaigns to be effective, the bank will know the right customers to target at the right time with the right messages or contents that will lead to large conversion.
